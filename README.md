# pptx-audio-speed-up
With online school, lessons that are posted as PowerPoint presentations with audio voice-overs are often paced slowly, and repeating or skipping over content is difficult with the PowerPoint UI. Converting the PPTX to a video file (and getting playback control in another software) would quickly consume my limited hardware memory, so I wrote a script to open the PPTX in my browser and give me full audio playback control.
